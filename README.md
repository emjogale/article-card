### Links

- Live Site URL: [https://article-card-emjogale.vercel.app/](https://article-card-emjogale.vercel.app/)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and grid layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I should write the README file alongside working on the project and not leave it until after I've finished!

### Continued development

I need to improve a lot on the implementation of the javascript aspects and also the css needs improvement - the active states aren't working correctly yet - certainly in some of the smaller screen sizes.
