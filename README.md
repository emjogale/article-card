### Built with

- Flexbox and grid layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I should write the README file alongside working on the project and not leave it until after I've finished!
Later when I revisited the project to improve the functionality (see continued development below) I learnt that it is good practice to avoid contamination in files and to keep the CSS and Javascript to their own files.

### Continued development

I need to improve a lot on the implementation of the javascript aspects and also the css needs improvement - the active states aren't working correctly yet - certainly in some of the smaller screen sizes.
I sought out some advice on the fact that the way I first implemented the active states was by changing the style property within the javascript file. This meant you had to click the button twice before the active state appeared. I sought some advice on this and was told that it is best to keep CSS out of the Javascript file - this was very good advice. I realised a much better way was to toggle a class which was defined in the CSS file.
